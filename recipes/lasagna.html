    <h2>Homemade Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Meat:</b> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½
        pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Onion:</b> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground
        meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>tomatoes:</b> /b> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of
        crushed tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fresh herbs:</b> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley
        and crush one clove of garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sugar:</b> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the
        tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Spices and seasonings:</b> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with
        dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Noodles:</b> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe
        calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to
        save time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cheese:</b> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and
        Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Eggs:</b> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as
        a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
      </li>
    </ul>
