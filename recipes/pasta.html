    <h2>How to Cook Pasta</h2>
    <p>If you can boil water, you can cook pasta. Here are a few simple tric</p>
    <h2>Ingredients and Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound uncooked pasta</li>
      <li>A large (6- to 8-quart) pot</li>
      <li>Four to six quarts of cold water</li>
      <li>1-2 tablespoons of salt</li>
      <li>A long-handled heat-proof spoon</li>
      <li>A colander for draining the pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>the water to a full, rolling boil.</b> Before adding the pasta,
        <b>add salt to the boiling water.</b> If you don't season the cooking
        water, the pasta may taste flat — no matter how salty the sauce may be.
        The temperature of the water will drop once you add the pasta, so make
        sure the water's at a full boil before adding the pasta noodles.
        <p>
          <b>*Note:</b> Be careful when you add the pasta to your boiling water;
          sometimes, the water can splash up and you don't want to burn your
          hands.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Stir gently.</b>Stir gently. Short pasta should be stirred
        immediately after adding it to water, but let spaghetti and long strands
        soften for a minute before stirring. Leave the pot uncovered while the
        pasta cooks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b
          >Cook your pasta at a rapid boil until it's tender but slightly firm
          to the bite.</b
        >
        The longer you cook pasta, the mushier it gets. Don't rely on the clock
        to evaluate doneness; bite a piece instead. If it's done, it will be
        firm but tender and cooked through. If you're using cooked pasta as an
        ingredient in a recipe — like baked ziti or lasagna — it can be even
        firmer, as the noodles will absorb liquid and cook more in the oven.
        <p>
          <b>*Note:</b> If you're tossing the pasta with a sauce,
          <b>reserve a cup or two of the cooking water</b> before you drain the
          pot. The starch in the cooking water can thin a thick sauce and help
          sauces stick to the noodles.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Drain the pasta in a colander.</b> Do not rinse the pasta with water
        unless your recipe specifically says to. For example, if you're making a
        cold pasta salad, you would rinse the hot pasta with cool water to stop
        the cooking. Lasagna is another example of a pasta noodle that can be
        rinsed after cooking. Otherwise, return the drained pasta to the pot and
        cover to keep it warm, or toss it with sauce. Here's where the reserved
        pasta water comes in handy to help thicken or thin the sauce, depending
        on the recipe you use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Serve pasta immediately.</b> We highly recommend using warm bowls!
